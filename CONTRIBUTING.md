To contribute, please fork master or dev. The dev branch will be updated much more frequently so it will be more up to date, but the master branch will be much more stable. I welcome code suggestions and improvements. And especially welcome new bots.

Bots may not access the cards of their opponents, nor the cards in the deck, nor may they directly edit the number of chips that they have. If contributors repeatedly violate this then they will be blocked.

I am hoping for a large collection of poker bots in this program eventually. Once you have commited a bot, if you want to improve him in any major way, please make a copy and rename the new onw leaving the last iteration in the program. This way we will be able to work to overcome our own previous bots.

Thanks!
