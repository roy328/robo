Structured coding process:
    •	Create/modify a design proposal in English (not code).
        o	Make sure your design reflects reality.
        o	Decide on the simplest iteration and add it to your proposal document.
    •	Work on the simplest iteration.
    •	Write up all bugs in the proposal document.
    •	Write and test code, throughout this process ask:
        o	Is my code readable?
        o	Do I have a good grasp of my code?
        o	Is my code flawed?
        o	Is my design correct?
        o	Have I run into too many bugs?
        o	Is there a simpler iteration I should write first?
    •	Once iteration is complete and tested, begin the next iteration from the top.
    •	We don’t need perfect code, just “good enough” code.
